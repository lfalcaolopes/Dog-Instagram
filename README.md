## 🔖 About 

The simplified thematic social network project is an application developed in TypeScript and React that uses a third-party public API to register and login users, in addition to allowing them to post photos and comments related to the chosen theme. The user interface is intuitive and easy to use, with a clean and modern design. Users can create profiles and interact with content posted by them. Integration with the API makes the development process more agile and simplified. The project is fully responsive and can be accessed from any device.

    ⚠️WARNING⚠️
</p >
<p align="center">
    When using a third-party public API, it is important to keep in mind that several people will have access to it and may post images and comments that do not align with the project's objectives. Posts that were not defined as standard by the API creator are deleted every 10 minutes, but during the project's access, it is possible that the API has not yet been reset to display only standard posts.
